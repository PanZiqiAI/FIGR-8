# FIGR-8

The FIGR-8 database is a dataset containing __17,375 classes__ of __1,548,256 images__ representing pictograms, ideograms, icons, emoticons or object or conception depictions. Its aim is to set a benchmark for Few-shot Image Generation tasks, albeit not being limited to it. Each image is represented by __192x192__ pixels with grayscale value of 0-255. Classes are not balanced (they do not all contain the same number of elements), but they all do contain at the very least 8 images.

The main contribution of this dataset to the community is the __abundance of image classes__, which is valuable for tasks in which encompassing an abundance of concepts can be useful or even necessary. This was the case in our paper, [FIGR: Few-shot Image Generation with Reptile](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02199 "arxiv link").

The dataset is readily available for people who want to give a shot at few-shot image generation techniques, while spending minimal effort on gathering a full-size database. We also encourage this dataset to enable reproduction efforts from the community.

### Contents

+ Data/
    + All images are contained in subfolders inside Data folder.
+ data.csv with the following information in order (see below for example):
    + Category number. All items from the same category name have the same category number. One category number per category name.
    + Category name. Also called "class". Represents what is depicted in the image.
    + Path. Represented as Category name/image_id. All images are in 192x192 with .png extension.
	+ Artist. The artist who designed the logo, the icon or the pictogram.
	+ License. The license type which the image is subject to. Refer to section License for more information.
